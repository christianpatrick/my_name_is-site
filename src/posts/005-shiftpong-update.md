The year was 2014, I was taking a break during the holidays and thought it'd be fun to learn a new language. Everywhere around me, people were watching Christmas movies, doing last-minute shopping, and here I was diving into Objective-C!

After a few months of casually playing with XCode and building a ton of sample apps, I released an app: ShiftPong! Some friends helped test it out before hitting the App Store, and even though I never made any "real" advertising money, it was a great learning experience to have a game in the App Store. (I did technically make $0.14 ðŸ’¸)

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I was cleaning up some old repo's on my computer and found this app again. I remembered there were some issues with its functionality on recent iOS devices, so I spent a few hours this weekend and worked them all out to make a functional and retina-friendly ðŸ¤“ game!

Here's what I learned, 2014's Christian had terrible coding-standards and really didn't know how to use Git very well. Seriously though, it's fun to see my first and only game working again and realizing that I am much better at coding games than playing them.

I'd love for you to give it a play and let me know your thoughts. It's not an entirely complex game at all and gives a few nods back to the Atari-Classic: [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).
