I haven't been playing keys much at all recently or crafting new sounds.

But for a new podcast I am starting, it was asked of me to do a sound similar to Stranger Things (Possibly one of the best shows I have ever watched)!  So here's what I came up with in Mainstage:

<audio controls class="center-block">
	<source type="audio/mp3" src="media/002-stranger_things-intro.mp3"></source>
	<p>Your browser does not support this media player.</p>
</audio>
