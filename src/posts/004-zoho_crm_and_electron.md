Recently my team has switched to Zoho for everything relating to our clients. Before using Zoho, we had a culmination of services that didn’t really talk together and finding info on a client in one place was ’near’ impossible. (Unless we wanted to spend an eternity connecting countless API's)

Enter [Zoho CRM](https://www.zoho.com/crm/). We’ve tried a number of CRM’s with varying levels of success, but now we can track everything from phone calls to Twitter DM’s... all from one place. #prettyschweet

Here’s my hang up with it though. I hate browser apps! Not completely, but when I’m using something off and on for hours a day, I want a dedicated app on my Mac. Usually I just run the awesome [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier), and it works perfectly. However this time, I just didn’t find myself happy with the way it looked. So... I decided to learn [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and try it myself. (I do recognize I have a problem lol)

So without further ado, here‘s my [Zoho CRM Electron app](https://github.com/christianpatrick/electron-zoho_crm).

If you have any ideas or issues with it, [I’d love to know](https://github.com/christianpatrick/electron-zoho_crm/issues)!
